## DVB direct handling tools for Linux

Easily handle DVB captures from the command line. In fact easier than using many fancy desktop apps.
You can watch a channel while recording it, or any other received in the same frequency.

### 'mpegts' tool

* Determine the TV channels in any recorded MPEG-TS file
* Show detailed information from any channel
* Play, save or compress a separate program (including all audio tracks and dvb subtitles)
* Actually it is a foolproof ffmpeg frontend to obviate the need for tens of parameters.
It requires the *ffmpeg* package (which provides ffmpeg, ffprobe and ffplay) and python 3.4+ installed.

### 'dvbjet' standalone DVB capture utility

* Tunes your TV card and saves the full plain MPEG stream for the selected frecuency, as with a radio.

* For example, the 60+ DVB-T channels in Madrid use only 9 frecuencies (482, 514, 570, 618, 698, 706, 746, 770 and 778 MHz).
The frequency 770000000 carries *TVE1*, *TVE2*, *24H* and *Clan* TV channels (including standard and HD variants) plus a few radio stations:

 ```shell
 $ dvbjet output.mts 3=770000000
 ```

* The generated file (standard MPEG-TS format) can be processed by the **mpegts** tool.
The frequencies used in your city can be found in configuration files (e.g. channels.conf) or running tools like *w_scan*.

* Besides the option number 3 shown here, all Linux DVB parameters are selectable by their standard ioctl system codes,
instead of the multiple names used out there. Run *dvbjet* without options for more information.
For example, outside Europe the option 5 may be required to setup the channel bandwidth.

* There is an option to schedule the unattended starting/end recording time. Recording is reliable and no data is lost
under high disk load; even a disk full may not cause  overrun errors (if space is freed soon enough).

* There aren't build dependencies, it only requires a non-Methuselah C++ compiler (circa 2013: gcc 4.8+ or clang)
and the system headers package (*linux-api-headers* in Arch, *kernel-headers* in Fedora, *linux-libc-dev*
in Ubuntu or *linux-glibc-devel* in Suse):

 ```shell
 $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/lightful/DVBdirect
 $ cd DVBdirect
 $ make
 ```
 Please, do not forget the *--recursive* option to download a required submodule (otherwise the build would fail).
 
 NOTE: if it says 
     fatal error: stropts.h: No such file or directory 
 do:
     touch /usr/include/stropts.h
